# a Custom Eclipse Fortify Plugin for Development

# Introduction

Fortify SCA is a tool that helps developers by making static security code analysis and detecting possible vulnerabilities that may cause problems in a live environment. This tool certainly increases the code quality of an enterprise and allows a software development team to fix security bugs before experiencing really big problems. The software I mentioned above is licenced by the [Micro Focus](https://www.microfocus.com/) Company and their enterprise solutions actually contain plugins for I.D.E.s as well. 

What I provided here is a custom Eclipe I.D.E plugin that facilitated "my way of implementation". This plugin itself is useless without **"a locally installed and licenced Fortify SCA on Windows O.S."** product. I -kind of- tried to convert the issues detected by the Fortify tool into a very simple check list, like we do when we go to shopping, nothing more. While implementing the solution, as I stated earlier, I tried to practice my rusty knowhow on SWT components and plugin development.

I repeat myself again: "You have to have a physical access to a computer on which Fortify SCA software is locally installed and licenced. Otherwise, this plugin is nothing more but garbage.
